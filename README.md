# TitanicSpaceship

Objective:

TitanicSpaceship is a Python class that implements an analysis of individuals that have been transported or not. The class reads training and test data from a YAML configuration file and preprocesses it for further analysis. The data is divided into two datasets, the training dataset and the test dataset. The class then uses machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN), and Logistic Regression to train a model to predict the individuals carried
